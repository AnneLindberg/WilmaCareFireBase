WilmaCareApp   


An app which is created to make communication between relatives of nursing home residents easier. 
WilmaCares overall vision is to create a society around those who have created the society we live in now.
WilmaCare is a platform created to be a platform for the Danish elderly care, a communication and coordination platform.
The app can be used by the relatives to the residents, however, it can also be used by the nursing staff, for easy communication between the two parties. 
The main functions of the app will be the; Dashboard, a small Calender like page, in which staff and relatives can post the relevant activities for the resident.
Lastly, another important part of the app is the resident page (Three of Life), where first and foremost, you can read about the resident, and obtain contact information for the residents contact person.
